The [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the Unleash SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry for review and analysis if an error occurs. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` (>=TODO:) and `UnleashClient` (>=6.0.1) from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk UnleashClient
```

## Configure

Add a `UnleashIntegration` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.unleash import UnleashIntegration
from UnleashClient import UnleashClient

unleash_client = UnleashClient(
    url="<Unleash server URL>/api/",  # "http://localhost:4242/api/" if you are self-hosting Unleash.
    app_name="my-app",                # Identifies your app in the Unleash UI.
    custom_headers={"Authorization": os.environ["UNLEASH_CLIENT_API_TOKEN"]}
)

unleash_integration = UnleashIntegration(unleash_client)

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        unleash_integration,
    ],
)
```

For more information on how to use Unleash, read Unleash's [Python reference](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/sdks/python) and [quickstart guide](https://docs.getunleash.io/quickstart).

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your Unleash SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Re-use `unleash_client` from the previous step.
test_flag_enabled = unleash_client.is_enabled("test-flag")

sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value
is equal to `test_flag_enabled`.

Note that we also track the `"enabled"` field in the results of [`get_variant()`](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/sdks/python#getting-a-variant) calls.
